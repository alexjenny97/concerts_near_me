## Have Nows:
- have link to axs ticket site for event

## Have to do:
- with driver use ticket link and a driver to access link page
- do the same thing and get ticket info
- could possibly get all the ticket prices at once
    - this would also give counts?

## Risks:
- Check out terms of service with all used websites
    - make a list of websites and thei TOS
- Ticket paages take longer/ varies in time

## Benefits:
- Easily available information
- I would go to cheape shows, but will not always look at price
